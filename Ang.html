	<h1> Autonomous driving </h1>

	<p>The subject of my talk is autonomous driving technology.   I would like to
		start by explaining what autonomous driving is.  It's a complex combination of
		various components that can be defined as systems where perception,  decision
		making , and operation of the automobile are performed by electronics rather
		than by human input.  There are several key components that I would like to
		focus on in this presentation.
	</p> 
	<p>I will be starting with the physical
		input needed to drive a car. Normally human controls the pedals and steering
		wheel to drive. Replacing that is as easy as adding actuators combined with a
		drive-by-wire connection to the steering. That enables electronics, with
		correctly programmed software, to steer and break or accelerate. For obvious
		reasons automatic transmission is preferred  in those type of vehicles.
		However there were models with manual transmission in early testing with
		actuators that could change gears.
	</p>
	<p> Another component already mentioned by me is the software needed to handle all the data. The data includes decision making which consists  of planning vehicle path, trajectory	and maneuvers.  Second data source are the sensors which include lidar, sonar,
		radar and cameras to monitor the vehicle surroundings and its position. Third
		data source is the cloud technology. It contains high-definition maps, traffic
		data, algorithms for object detection, classification and decision making. It
		can be updated by other vehicles and let them communicate to further improve
		their drive ability. Another source of data are localization and mapping
		services, which can use the current vehicle position and maps from the cloud
		to help the algorithms plot best possible route to its destination.
	</p>
	<p>
		Going back to the sensors used to gather data from the surroundings. One of them mentioned by me was lidar. What is lidar? Lidar is a surveying method that measures distance to a target by illuminating that target with a pulsed laser light, and measuring the reflected pulses with a sensor. Differences in laser return times and wavelengths can then be used to make digital 3D-representations of the target. The name lidar, is an acronym of Light Detection And Ranging. Sonar is a similar technology but instead of light it uses sound.
	</p>
	<p> Now I want to talk about a real life example. To show the importance of software in autonomous driving I can point out Tesla. Tesla is an automotive company from USA. They have revolutionalised the field of electric cars and introduced autonomous driving for the masses. Whereas in normal car upgrading software won't lead to any substantial gains,
		Tesla in their cars can change vehicle characteristics just by upgrading their
		software. For example early models of Tesla S when updated gained few split
		seconds in their 0-60mph time, better fuel efficiency and autonomous driving
		upgrades. Something our 'normal' cars can just dream of.
	</p>
	<p> We've looked
		at software, now lets talk about hardware. In our laptops most of us probably
		have 4 processors. In a modern Tesla car there are about 65 processors, with
		different computing powers and with data comparison capabilities. The
		processors take in data from up to 12 cameras positioned around the car, and
		combine it with extensive  "deep learning" to teach the car to sense and
		interpret what is taking place around it.
	</p>
	<p> What is  'deep learning' you
		might ask. Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches
		computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. Deep
		learning is a key technology behind  driverless cars, enabling them to
		recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. Crucial
		feature in a car that needs to be able to make that sort of decisions.
	</p>
	<p>Moving on now to legal challenges for autonomous vehicles. The fast
		emergance of this technology suprised the governments, because there were no
		laws stating who is responsible for a self- driving car. There are also
		different levels of assistance from the automated systems. From lane- assist
		which many  manufacturers now implement in their cars to full automated trucks
		that are being developed and tested for automated hauling of goods in the
		future. Imagine whole fleets of self driving trucks delivering goods and when
		developed  nd implemented in the right way being even more safe than a real
		driver. For example: can a computer  fall asleep at the wheel? If it has
		different redundancies offering it the ability to protect its systems from power failures and cloud connection problems, it would definitely be safer.
	</p>
	<p> But that point brings me to another topic of concern. What happens when someone else 	 takes control of your car?	Those are the issues manufacturers will have  to take 		into consideration. But for now governments around the world support autonomous 		vehicle technology. The German transport minister has proposed a bill 
		to provide a legal framework for the use of autonomous 
		vehicles, aiming to put fully autonomous vehicles on  
		an equal legal footing to human drivers. 
	</p>
	<p>For example, in 2015 the European Commission voted in favour 
		of legislation to require that from April 2018, all cars sold in 
		Europe are equipped with eCall, a system that automatically 
		contacts emergency services and directs them to the vehicle 
		location in the event of a serious crash.This shows that the governments take new technologies seriously and in the future this could make autonomous driving required in newly produced cars.
	</p>

	<p>To sum up this technology has tremendous potential and developing it will definitely 	be a challenging task.
		However in the future it could change our lives for the better.
